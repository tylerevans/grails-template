						<b>TERMS, CONDITIONS AND WARRANTIES</b>
					</p>

					<p class='description'>
						<b>Prepaid Hotel Transactions</b>
					</p>

					<p class='description'>You agree that your credit card will be
						charged for the full cost of your reservation upon submitting your
						reservation request. The cost of your reservation is the total of
						the indicated room rate multiplied by the number of days in your
						reservation, plus an additional amount for the tax recovery
						charges and our service fees. The tax recovery charge is assessed
						to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your
						reservation for sales and use, occupancy room tax, excise tax,
						value added and other similar taxes, and the balance of the
						additional amount is a fee we charge in connection with the
						handling of your reservation. Our service fee varies based on the
						amount and location of your reservation.</p>

					<p class='description'>We are not the vendor collecting and
						remitting said tax to the applicable tax authorities. The vendors
						bill all applicable taxes to us and we remit such tax directly to
						the vendor. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with
						whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements.
						Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location.
						Our actual tax cost paid to the vendor may vary from the tax
						recovery charge, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc., in
						effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel, automobile,
						etc., by our customer.</p>

					<p class='description'>You may cancel or change your prepaid
						reservation, but you will be charged the cancellation or change
						fee indicated on the reservation order form. In addition, if you
						do not cancel or change your reservation before the cancellation
						policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, which varies
						by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours prior to your date of arrival),
						you will be subject to a charge of one night's room rate, tax
						recovery charges and service fees. No refunds will be made for
						no-shows or early checkouts. See the hotel description for the
						cancellation policy period for each hotel. You agree to pay any
						cancellation or change fee that you incur. In some cases, hotels
						do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after
						they are made, generally for stays during holiday periods or
						special events. You will be notified before the reservation order
						is completed and your credit card is charged if a reservation is
						non-refundable or non-changeable. You agree to abide by the terms
						and conditions imposed with respect to any conditions imposed with
						respect to any completed reservation order for a hotel stay as
						specified on the reservation order form.</p>

					<p class='description'>The Company attempts to secure the best
						hotel rates available. The Company's guarantee provides limited
						assurance that our rates on prepaid hotel transactions are the
						lowest rates available. If a lower room rate is available to you
						for the same dates and the same hotel and you contact us prior to
						the property's cancellation deadline, we will either refund the
						difference or cancel your reservation without cancellation fee or
						other charge. This guarantee does not apply to special events such
						as New Year's Eve and the Super Bowl or to non-refundable or
						non-changeable reservations.</p>

					<p class='description'>
						<b>Travel Destinations</b>
					</p>


					<p class='description'>Although most travel, including travel
						to international destinations, is completed without incident,
						travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than
						others. IAN.com urges passengers to review travel prohibitions,
						warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the United States
						Government prior to booking travel to international destinations.
						Information on conditions in various countries and the level of
						risk associated with travel to particular international
						destinations can be found at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov,

						PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, IAN DOES NOT REPRESENT OR
						WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH POINTS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK,
						AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM
						TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.</p>
